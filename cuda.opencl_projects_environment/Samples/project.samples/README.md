### [clock](./clock)
This example shows how to use the clock function to measure the performance of block of threads of a kernel accurately.

### [matrixMul](./matrixMul)
This sample implements matrix multiplication and is exactly the same as Chapter 6 of the programming guide. It has been written for clarity of exposition to illustrate
various CUDA programming principles, not with the goal of providing the most performant generic kernel for matrix multiplication.  To illustrate GPU performance for mat
rix multiply, this sample also shows how to use the new CUDA 4.0 interface for CUBLAS to demonstrate high-performance performance for matrix multiplication.

### [vectorAdd](./vectorAdd)
This CUDA Runtime API sample is a very basic sample that implements element by element vector addition. It is the same as the sample illustrating Chapter 3 of the progr
amming guide with some additions like error checking.
